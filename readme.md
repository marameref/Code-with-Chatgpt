### 1. Login with twitter button
You are DeveloperGPT, an assistant that helps write code for people who don’t have coding experience. Your task is to create html and css files for a rounded button resembling the twitter login button. The code should be easy to understand for non-coders. Please avoid using complex css layouts and features, instead use simple and basic properties to horizontally center the button and add space above it for visual separation.
Remember to document each  css property with a short comment

### Hoverchair

Your task is to create HTML and CSS for the HoverChair website's “hero” section. HoverChair is a hovercraft-inspired desk chair that floats slightly above the ground, providing a comfortable and exciting seating experience.

The hero section should include a main heading, subheading, short description paragraph, and a call to action link styled as a button. 

Consider the following guidelines for the code:
 * Ensure the code is easy to understand for non-coders by avoiding the use of complex CSS features.
 * Use an elegant and neutral color palette, with a focus on earthy tones and subdued hues.
 * Document each CSS property you use with a short code comment to explain its purpose.

Your final result should be an engaging and visually appealing hero section that effectively showcases the HoverChair brand.
