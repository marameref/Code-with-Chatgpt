## Firebase
Please evaluate the JavaScript code for my Interactive Event Invite project:
 
```
```
 
Your task is to add the Firebase Realtime Database to this project.
* Save only the submitted message to the database if attendance === 'yes'.
* All of the latest messages data needs to appear as list items in the messages list.
 
Add detailed comments to help me understand the new Firebase code.
