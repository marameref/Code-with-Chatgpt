## Prompt 1

Hey there! I've got this exciting idea to create a cake raffle web app. I'm considering using HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript for this.
 
I envision a form where users can enter their names to participate. Once we have all the 
participants, there should be a 'Draw' button that, when clicked, picks a random winner from the 
pool. 
 
Please outline the basic steps to get started.
